               POLAND – Information on Tax Identification Numbers

Section I – TIN Description

I. TIN description
1.1. PESEL description
As from 1st September 2011, Poland recognizes as a tax identification number the PESEL number issued to natural persons
registered in PESEL register and who do not conduct business activity and are not registered for value added tax purposes.

PESEL is a 11-digit, constant numeric symbol, that uniquely identifies a specific individual registered in the PESEL database
(the Common Electronic System of Population Register). Data stored in the Common Electronic System of Population Register
is transferred from the municipal offices' database, which are the municipal registration records.

PESEL register operates since 1977 and contains details of persons residing permanently in the territory of the Republic of
Poland, domiciled for permanent or temporary (more than 3 months) residence and persons applying for an identity card or
passport, as well as people who under the provisions of Polish law need to have a social security number. PESEL numbers are
issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

1.2. TIN description
As from 1st of September 2011, Poland issues TINs to other entities, which are subject to registration (i.e. individuals, legal
persons, individuals who do not have the legal personality and other entities) provided that, according to the Polish acts, they
are defined as taxpayers or payers of social security or health insurance contributions.

However, TIN number assigned to the date 31st August 2011 becomes a tax identification number under the provisions of Act
of 29 July 2011 concerning the rules governing registration and identification (Official Journal No 171, item 1016), and thus
decisions on granting such a tax identification number remain in force.
