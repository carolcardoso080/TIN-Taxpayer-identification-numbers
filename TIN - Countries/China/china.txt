Information on Tax Identification Numbers (The information is to be considered as preliminary guidance only. Should there be any inconsistency between Chinese and English version, the Chinese version shall prevail.)

Section I – TIN Description

Entities: Generally TIN of an entity is the Uniform Social Credit Code which can be found on the
entity’s Business Licence. If no Uniform Social Credit Code is obtained by the entity, its TIN (18
digits) is assigned by local tax office according to relevant rules. During current transition period, the
15-digit old TIN is still in use for some entities, printed on the Tax Registration Certificate.

Individual: TIN depends on its identification. For an individual using Chinese ID card as its
identification, TIN is the ID number. For an individual using passport or other ID certificate as its
identification, TIN is issued by local tax office according to relevant rules. In some regions, passport
numbers are also recognized as TIN for foreign individuals.

Taxpayer who registered with tax authority was issued a certificate of tax registration that contains its
TIN. Under the new TIN regime, taxpayer who registers with industry & commerce authority will be
issued a business licence that contains its Uniform Social Credit Code, which is also its TIN. For an
individual using Chinese ID card as its identification, its TIN number is shown on its identification
card. For an individual using passport or other ID certificate as its identification, its TIN number is
usually shown on a Tax-Paid Certificate which could be obtained from the local tax office.
