Information on Tax Identification Numbers

Section I - TIN Description

The United Arab Emirates does not issue Tax Identification Numbers (″TINs″). Therefore, TINs
are not automatically issued for Individuals and Entities.

The United Arab Emirates issues Tax Residency Certificates (″TRCs″) (also known as Tax
Domicile Certificates) upon application of an eligible individual or entity based on the applicable
Double Taxation Treaty. The TRCs are valid for one year and do not carry a TIN.

The United Arab Emirates introduced Value Added Tax (″VAT″) on 1 January 2018. The VAT
numbers issued do not correspond with the classification of TINs. Therefore, a VAT number
may not be used in lieu of a TIN.
