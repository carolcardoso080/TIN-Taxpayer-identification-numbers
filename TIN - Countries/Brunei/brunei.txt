Information on Tax Identification Numbers

Section I – TIN Description

Please provide a narrative description of the criteria governing the issuance of the TIN (e.g. some
jurisdictions may only issue TINs to individuals, or to individuals that are filing tax returns; other
jurisdictions may also issue TINs to (a subset of) Entities). In addition, information about the TIN
issuing bodies, as well as the taxes for which the TIN is used as means of identification (e.g. income
tax, wage tax, withholding taxes, VAT, etc.). In case a jurisdiction issues separate TINs for different
taxes (e.g. income taxes, VAT, etc.), please only provide information in relation to the TINs you
would expect to be provided for identification purposes in the context of the CRS.

Furthermore, jurisdictions may provide any useful information regarding the validity and frequency
of renewal of TINs, as well as any recent changes made to the structure of their TINs.

Any further information regarding TINs that jurisdictions deem useful for publication on the CRS
