Information on Tax Identification Numbers

Section I – TIN Description

Pursuant to article 26(2)(b) of the Law 21/2014, of 16 October, on the basis of the tax system, taxable
subjects shall obtain and use a Número de Registre Tributari (NRT, Tax Register Number) when carrying
out transactions involving Andorran taxation. Article 13(1) of the Tax Management Regulations
establishes that “natural and legal persons and other taxable subjects, be they resident o non-resident,
shall obtain a Tax Register Number (NRT) for their transactions involving Andorran taxation.”
For natural persons resident in Andorra, the NRT is the Número d’Identificació Administrativa
(Administrative Identification Number, NIA), preceded by the letter “F” (article 14 Regulations). The
NIA is regulated by Law 8/2007, of 17 May, on the regulation of the Administrative Identification
Number.

For natural persons non-resident in Andorra, the NRT is the Número d’Identificació Administrativa
(Administrative Identification Number, NIA) granted to them, preceded by the letter “E” (article 15
Regulations).

For legal persons and entities without legal personality, the Tax Administration will assign a unique
number, regardless the fact that they are resident or not in the Principality of Andorra. This number is
invariable unless there is a change of legal form or nationality (article 16 Regulations).
